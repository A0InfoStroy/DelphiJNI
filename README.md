# DelphiJNI
A Delphi/Kylix Java Native Interface implementation .

This conversion allows to call Java programs from Delphi
and Delphi programs (.dll or .so) from Java. Data can be exchanged.
Since Java programs are platform independent it also works
for Linux.

The JNI_MD.INC file is the same for all versions (even Linux)
